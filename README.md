# Wandering bot in a maze

This is a final project for EEP 520 Spring 2021. The goal for me is to build a wandering robot in a maze and watch it trying to get out of the maze and touch the green box. This system is built using [Elma](https://github.com/klavinslab/elma) and [Enviro](https://github.com/klavinslab/enviro)
