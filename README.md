This is a final project for EEP 520 Spring 2021. The goal of is to build a wandering robot in a maze for the user to watch it trying to get out of the maze and touch the green box. The main purpose is to build a system that is for user to watch relaxingly (like a screensaver) and not to get out of the maze efficiently and quickly. This system is built using [Elma](https://github.com/klavinslab/elma) and [Enviro](https://github.com/klavinslab/enviro)

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a good enough robot to get out of the maze and not to be stucked in the maze forever and not moving. The key challenges include building a good enough robot that will not get stuck forever in the maze but at the same time not too good that it will get out of the maze quickly and efficiently. The goal of this project is to build a cute robot for a day to day software developer to stare at and zone out to comfort their eyes and soul.
